MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT:
  small level editor. features a world, with 6 rooms max. a room is a square box
  with a size of 64x64 tiles, totalling up to 128 tiles each room. you can place
  rooms down anywhere within a world, and connect rooms to other rooms. 
    any room that is neither of:
      A. The Start Room.
      B. The End Room.
      or C. Connected to another room.
  will be disposed of upon building. levels can be moved around freely in the world
  by either holding down a key ( ALT perhaps? ) and left clicking, or zooming out
  and left clicking.
  there should also always be a start room. room_0 will always be start by default,
  but the start room should be changable. every room must also contain an entry point,
  and either one of:
    A game end point
    or
    A level end point.
  the game end point, as the name suggests, just ends the game.
  the level end point ends the level, and must be connected to another active level.
  if no active levels are available the level end point will be turned into a game end
  point.


FUTURE GOALS:
    every room can contain two types of objects:
      Tiles: Static tiles. snapped to grid. can be collidable or not.
      Entities: Interactable objects. can
