# Ledit ( working name )

a small mario maker style game written in rust :)


# Installation

## If you have cargo installed:
clone the repo with 
```
git clone git@github.com:derpyzza/ledit.git
```
and just run
```
cargo run
```

## If you do not have cargo installed:
install cargo using the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

I'd also recommend reading the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) if you're unfamiliar with rust :)
